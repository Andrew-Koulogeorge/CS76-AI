# COSC76-AI
Dartmouth Computer Science 76 - Artificial Intelligence Problem Sets

This repo contains the solutions to the problem sets for the above course at Dartmouth College, taught by Professor Devin Balkcom in Fall 2023. Each directory includes both code and a report exploring the theoretical ideas of the algorithms being implemented. 

Problem set descriptions can be found on the public web page for the course [here](https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~devin/cs76/syllabus/index.html).

If you have any questions regarding my solutions, feel free to reach out to me at [andrew.j.koulogeorge.24@dartmouth.edu](mailto:andrew.j.koulogeorge.24@dartmouth.edu)
